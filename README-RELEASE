Release procedure:

 * Go in parent directory

 * Prepare for release
  * Clean everything
    -> mvn -Dtycho.mode=maven clean
  * change the version to a fixed one (for example, if we were to 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT, go to 2.1.0) (note: it won't change the osgi versions, on purpose to keep the qualifier)
    -> mvn -Dtycho.mode=maven versions:set -DnewVersion=2.1.0
  * commit and tag the release
    -> hg commit -m "prepare for 2.1.0 release"
    -> hg tag v2.1.0

 * Do the release
  * Compile, install in the local repository and deploy (the install is needed for the deploy to work after because of a bug in tycho repository which clean when deploy is called, and thus installed artefacts are used for deployment)
    -> mvn package install deploy
    
 * Increment for development
  * Clean everything
    -> mvn -Dtycho.mode=maven clean
  * change the version (note: it will change the osgi version AND the pom versions)
    -> mvn -Dtycho.mode=maven versions:set -DnewVersion=2.1.0-SNAPSHOT (needed for the next command to succeed updating osgi versions)
    -> mvn -Dtycho.mode=maven org.eclipse.tycho:tycho-versions-plugin:set-version -DnewVersion=2.2.0-SNAPSHOT
  * commit
    -> hg commit -m "increment to 2.2.0 development version"

 * Develop!


Notes:
 * -Dtycho.mode=maven prevents tycho from resolving the p2 repositories when not needed (clean, set-version...)
